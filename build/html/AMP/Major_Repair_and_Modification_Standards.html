<p>Any document issued by the manufacturer of aircraft, engine, propeller, and other appliance or by the airworthiness authority can be classified into two classes: mandatory and non-mandatory.</p>
<p>Mandatory will be complied with under the same procedures as the AD prescribed previously.
Decision to compliance with the non-mandatory such as Service Bulletin (SB), Service Letters (SL), and other similar documents shall be at the discretion of the company management through the maintenance division recommendation.</p>
<p>The responsible person in Maintenance Section must set up the job based on the non-mandatory which has been designed to act to the effected aircraft.</p>
